# ULTIMA ONLINE ART MODS 
# Magic Scrolls
Aims to quickly convey the use and importance of certain scrolls . a somewhat simpler stylized scroll with ribbon colorized by harmful \ benefical \ utility . Low circle spell scrolls are desaturated and rough looking in contrast to higher 6+ circle spells glowing and resembling the spell they contain . Lastly useful spell scrolls like Recall are shown glowing and easily distinguishable even tho they are lower 4th circle . Credit and Thanks to Gaechti for all the great Patcher tools as well as their ScrollsByCircle mod which was the basis and template of this mod .

# UO Outlands
in launcher settings uncheck automatic patch , then on reopen will see the difference in client vs server patch and can skip ( cancel patch ) if the difference is small and only apart of changes made by the mods patched in . if see multiple of the .mul files with differences then the server patched and should update to match then reapply the art mods using the multipatcher .
