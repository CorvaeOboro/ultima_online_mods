# ULTIMA ONLINE ART MODS 
# Magic Scrolls
Aims to quickly convey the use and importance of certain scrolls .
- a somewhat simpler stylized scroll with ribbon colorized by harmful \ benefical \ utility . 
- Low circle spell scrolls are desaturated and rough looking in contrast to higher 6+ circle spells glowing and resembling the spell they contain .
- Useful spell scrolls like Recall are shown glowing and easily distinguishable even when they are lower 4th circle .
- Credit and Thanks to Gaechti for all the great tools and guides as well as their ScrollsByCircle mod which was the basis and template of this mod .

- fantastic server , highly reccomend ! some notes for using art mods with their launcher :

- in launcher > gear > settings > uncheck automatic patch , close .
- then on reopen will see the difference in client vs server patch and can skip ( cancel patch ) if the difference is small and only apart of changes made by the mods patched in . 
- if see multiple of the .mul files with differences then the server patched and you should Apply Patch to update to match the latest then reapply the art mods using the Mulpatcher .
